# Introduction

# Ethnic or Civic Conception of _the People_

**Ethnic Conception hypothesis** (_H1_):  All things equal, agreement with the constitutive items of the populist attitude construct containing a reference to 'the people' is lower for an ethnic conception of the 'the people' (i.e., das Volk) than for a civic conception of 'the people' (i.e., Bürger).e.

**Exclusive National Identity hypothesis** (_H2a_):  All things equal, agreement with the constitutive items of the populist attitude construct containing a reference to 'the people' is higher for an ethnic conception of 'the people' (i.e., das Volk) than for a civic conception of 'the people' (i.e., Bürger) when the respondent adheres to an exclusive national identity.

**Far Right Party ID hypothesis** (_H2b_): All things equal, agreement with the constitutive items of the populist attitude construct containing a reference to 'the people' is higher for an ethnic conception of 'the people' (i.e., das Volk) than for a civic conception of 'the people' (i.e., Bürger) when the respondent votes for a far right party. 


# Data, Measurement & Method

## Data
The survey experiment is conducted in Germany between the 13th of October 2021 and the 11th of November 2021.
The sample, recruited through [Respondi](https://www.respondi.com/EN/), consists of 8,000 participants (based on the power analysis presented in Figure \ref{fig:power}) of 18 years and older.
Respondi works with opt-in respondents, so we have implemented quota on age, gender, and education.
Moreover, we measure some more demographic background variables (see the [Measurement Section](#control-variables)).
Balance checks are conducted to demonstrate whether certain categories are over represented in a certain experimental group (see [the Methods Section](#method), Figure \ref{fig:balance}).
The study has been approved by the [Research Ethics Review Committee](https://fsw.vu.nl/nl/onderzoek/research-ethics-review/index.aspx) of the \textit{Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam} (see the approval [here](../docs/RERC_VU_wording-experiment.pdf)).
To ensure good quality of our data, two attention checks are included.
Each respondent failing the attention check will be excluded and replaced with another 'good' response.

## Measurement

**_Dependent Variables_**
Measuring populist attitudes, three of the six items mention _the people_.
We rely on those three items in the populism scale. See Table \ref{tab:dv} in the [Appendix](# Appendix A. Wording of the questionaire) for the exact phrasing of the question.
Each item is used on a 5-point likert scale: from `very much disagree` (value of `0`) till `very much agree` (value of `5`).
The average for each of the items lies between 3 and 4 (with a standard deviation around 1), meaning that people are neutral till positive about these statements. 

```{r descriptive-table, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
descr <- d %>%
  select(matches("POST_[234]")) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything()) %>%
  mutate(Variable = recode(name,
                       `POST_2` = "DV: People, not politicians, \n should make the most \n important political decisions",
                       `POST_3` = "DV: MPs should follow \n the will of the people",
                       `POST_4` = "DV: Differences between elites and \n the people are bigger than \n differences between the people")) %>%
  group_by(Variable) %>%
  summarise(`Mean Value` = round(mean(value, na.rm = T),2),
            `St.dev` = round(sd(value, na.rm = T), 2),
            `Min. Value` = min(value),
            `Max. Value` = max(value))

kbl(descr, booktabs =T, caption = "\\label{tab:descr-dv}Descriptive Information of Dependent Variables",
    digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"),
                full_width = F, fixed_thead = T, position = "center")  %>%
   column_spec(1, width = "5.5cm") %>%
   column_spec(2, width = "2cm") %>%
   column_spec(3, width = "1.5cm") %>%
   column_spec(4, width = "2cm") %>%
   column_spec(5, width = "2cm")
rm(descr)  
```

**_Experimental Condition_**
Given the historical context of Germany, we randomize whether _the people_ is translated into German using either the civic conception (i.e. _Bürger_) or the ethnic conception (i.e. _Volk_).
`50.2\%` of the respondents (3347 in total) got the civic conception treatment, and `49.8\%` of the respondents (3317 in total) was randomized into the ethnics conception treatment.

**_Covariates_**
Because Respondi works with an opt-in sample, we have background information on age, gender, educational level, geographical region, vote recall, emplyment, and income.
In our [online compendium](https://github.com/MarikenvdVelden/wording-experiment-populist-attitudes), we demonstrate all the descriptive information.
As detailed in our pre-analysis plan, we only include variables as covariates that are unbalanced. 
As Figure \ref{balance} shows, only the income covariate is unbalanced accross the experimental groups. 
We therefore add this covariate to the regression analyses (H2a and H2b).

```{r balance, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "95%", fig.cap = "\\label{fig:balance}Balance Checks"}
include_graphics(here("report/figures", "balance-checks-1.png"))
```


## Method
To test the _Ethnic Conception hypothesis_ (H1), we conducted a difference in means for the group who received the ethnic and the civic question wording, for all populist items containing a reference to _the people_.
To test whether H1 is conditional upon having an exclusive national identity (_H2a_) and/or voting for a far right party (_H2b_) we use linear multivariate regressions, with an interaction between the treatment conditions and the variable of interest in the heterogenous treatment (i.e. respectively having a exclusive national identity and voting for a far right party).

```

```{r results-h2, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "\\label{fig:results-h2}Results: H2"}
