# 'Das Volk' or 'Bürger'? 
Online research compendium of the paper entitled _'Das Volk' or 'Bürger'? The Implications of Ethnic and Civic Conceptions of the People for the Measurement of Populist Attitudes_ . This repository combines the [pre-registration plan](https://github.com/MarikenvdVelden/wording-experiment-populist-attitudes/blob/master/docs/pap/pap.pdf) (see also [here](https://osf.io/d6q5b/)) with a data &amp; analysis compendium.

## Pre-Registration Plan
* [Experiment](docs/pap/pap.pdf) The theoretical underpinnings and research design to test the implications of an ethnic or civic conception on the people for the measurement of populist attitudes (_hypotheses 1--2_).

## Data
The following data files might be of interest:

* [Experiment ](data/intermediate/cleaned_experiment.RData) Cleaned data with constructed scales for analysis of the experiment 1 in which we test whether the ethnic conception of the people makes people less populist compared to a civic conception (_hypothesis 1_), conditional upon strength of national identity and strength of partisan id for a far right party (_hypotheses 2_).

See the scripts in [src/data-processing](src/data-processing/prep_data.md) for details on how these files were constructed.

## Results
* [Experiment](src/analysis/analyses.md) Demonstrates the analyses to test and visualise hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2. In addition, we report the exploratory results for:
	- Alternative model specification H1
	- Interactions with Age, Region, and Ideology
	- Confirmatory Factor Analysis
